# Connection

A MQTT connection declares the MQTT broker/server that will receive and send the MQTT messages and also the information of how that connection is established.

There are 2 types of connections: `MQTT 5` and `MQTT 3`. The general configuration is very similar, we will see later that `MQTT 5` introduced new features that are only supported by this type of connection.
