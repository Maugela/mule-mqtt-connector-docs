# Connection

A MQTT connection declaration declares the MQTT broker/server that will receive and send the MQTT messages and also more information of how that connection is established.

There are 2 types of connections: `MQTT 5` and `MQTT 3`. The configuration is pretty similar, we will see later that `MQTT 5` delivers more features than `MQTT 3`.
